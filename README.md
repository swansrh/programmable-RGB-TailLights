Custom RGB Tail Lights using LED Strips

The goal for this project is to create custom RGB LED Tail Lights for a road legal vehicle
I personally will be working with a 1998 BMW e46

My first thought would be to have use a 2d LED Matrix as the canvas for all of my lights (Brake, Reverse, Indicator, Night Lights)
Once an LED matrix has been made, each indivudla LED can be added coloured to make the shape of the light.

This would all be controlled from a small 7-10 inch touch screen mounted in the cabin
Said screen would allow the driver to change how the lights displayed colour for full customisation

I would like this to eventually include a dashboard with different modes including the ability to create custom animations

I am happy for anyone to have a look at this project and use this project on their own car
